## Gameplay Overview
### Theme / Setting / Genre

It’s an Action/Adventure game that takes place in a spaceship and in space, thus having a sci-fi feeling to it. It’s set in the far future, where humans have evolved their technologies and are now trying to discover and explore new planets. Unlike the expectations from the theme space/action games, ours brings to the table an element of fun to that concept, pushing the player to think a bit differently to do the missions. The expectation for this game is to create comical situations for the player to interact and figure out how to react to it. To achieve this, we will try to make the resolution of the missions in unconventional way.
